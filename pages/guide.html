  <h1>BestClassic Emulator Use Guide</h1>
    <p>
    (Before you start playing your game, make sure to close a glitchy mini-window that sometimes opens up when the page is first loaded. Use the 'x' button on the top right of the small window within the emulator window)
    
    The emulator script used by BestClassic can be interacted with and customized by using  different widgets on the bottom bar. This guide will go through every widget from left to right.
    
    Widget 1: Restart
    This widget allows the user to revert the game back to its starting state, as if you had reloaded the page. 
    
    Widget 2: Pause
    This widget pauses any game at any time, more useful than most built in pause functions.
    Widget 3: Save State
    Whenever this widget is clicked, the state of the game at that moment will be loaded into memory, saving your game exactly when you clicked the widget.
    
    Widget 4: Load State
    Whenever this widget is clicked, the save state that you have last loaded using Widget 3 will be loaded onto your current window of play. This widget is used to load a save that you have previously made.
    
    Widget 5: Netplay
    This can be used in order to set up connections through local multiplayer. THIS ONLY WORKS FOR MULTIPLAYER GAMES. It has a relatively low chance of working either way, so do not expect perfect functionality.
    
    Widget 6: Controls settings
    The emulator script loads every single possible button and part of a modern game controller. Not all of this will be used for every controller. Find your console in this list to find important settings for each console.
    
    NES: Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, Start, Select
    
    SNES: Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, X, Y, Shoulder L, Shoulder R, Start, Select
    
    Gameboy: Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, Start, Select
    
    Gameboy Advance: Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, Shoulder L, Shoulder R, Start, Select
    
    Nintento 64: Up, Down, Left, Right, Left Stick Up, Left Stick Down, Left Stick Left, Left Stick Right, Right Stick Up, Right Stick Down, Right Stick Left, Right Stick Right, Start, Select, Shoulder R, Shoulder L2, A, B
    
    (For N64, certain games require the dpad and Shoulder L. These games are: Kirby 64, Dr Mario 64, and Pokemon Stadiums 1 and 2.)
    
    Nintendo DS: Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, X, Y, Left Shoulder, Right Shoulder.
    
    
    Widget 7: Volume
    use this widget to adjust the volume of your game.
