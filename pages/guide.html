  <h1>BestClassic Emulator Use Guide</h1>
	<p> (Before you start playing your game, make sure to close a glitchy mini-window that sometimes opens up when the page is first loaded. Use the 'x' button on the top right of the small window within the emulator window)</p>
	<h2>Controls</h2>	
   	 <p>
    The emulator script used by BestClassic can be interacted with and customized by using  different widgets on the bottom bar. This guide will go through every widget from left to right.
    <br>
		 <strong>Widget 1: Restart</strong>
    This widget allows the user to revert the game back to its starting state, as if you had reloaded the page. 
    <br>
		 <strong>Widget 2: Pause</strong>
    This widget pauses any game at any time, more useful than most built in pause functions.
	    <br>
		 <strong>Widget 3: Save State</strong>
    Whenever this widget is clicked, the state of the game at that moment will be loaded into memory, saving your game exactly when you clicked the widget.
            <br>
		 <strong>Widget 4: Load State</strong>
    Whenever this widget is clicked, the save state that you have last loaded using Widget 3 will be loaded onto your current window of play. This widget is used to load a save that you have previously made.
            <br>
    <strong>Widget 5: Netplay</strong>
    This can be used in order to set up connections through local multiplayer. THIS ONLY WORKS FOR MULTIPLAYER GAMES. It has a relatively low chance of working either way, so do not expect perfect functionality.
	    <br>
	    <strong>Widget 6: Controls settings</strong>
    The emulator script loads every single possible button and part of a modern game controller. Not all of this will be used for every controller. Find your console in this list to find important settings for each console.
